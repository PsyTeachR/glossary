For example, you could concatenate the numbers 1, 3, 6, and 10 like this: c(1, 3, 6, 10). You can concatenate two vectors as well: v1 &lt;- 1:5 v2 &lt;- 11:15 c(v1, v2) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 Remember, a vector can only have one data type.

For example, 95% Confidence Intervals of the mean state that if you were to run the same study on 100 samples and calculate this interval for each iteration of the study, then 95 of the intervals calculated will contain the true mean of the population. Most commonly cited Confidence Intervals are the 95% Confidence Interval and the 99% Confidence Interval. The 95% CI and 99% CI of the mean are calculated as follows: \\(95\\%\\ CI = \\mu ± 1.96 \\times SD\\) \\(99\\%\\ CI = \\mu ± 2.58 \\times SD\\) For example, given \\(\\mu\\) = 10 and \\(SD\\) = 1.25, the \\(95\\%\\ CI = [7.55, 12.45]\\) There are a number of misconceptions about Confidence Intervals and it would be worth reading the following papers: Greenland, S., Senn, S.J., Rothman, K.J. et al. Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations.

You are generally interested in how other variables you have measured impact the dependent variable. For example, if you are testing the effect of stress on anxiety, stress would be your independent variable and anxiety would be the dependent variable. The terms independent/dependent variable are typically used in an experimental context. In the context of regression, the dependent variable is often referred to as the response variable. deviation score A score minus the mean tibble( score = 8:12 ) %&gt;% mutate(mean = mean(score), deviation_score = score - mean) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## score mean deviation_score ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 8 10 -2 ## 2 9 10 -1 ## 3 10 10 0 ## 4 11 10 1 ## 5 12 10 2 discrete Data that can only take certain values, such as integers.

The result of a filtering join will only contain rows from the left table and have the same number or fewer rows than the left table. A semi_join returns all rows from the left table where there are matching values in the right table, keeping just columns from the left table. Figure 2: Semi Join An anti_join return all rows from the left table where there are not matching values in the right table, keeping just columns from the left table. Figure 3: Anti Join fitted value The value of the response variable predicted by the model given certain values for any predictor variables. If you have a model \\[Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + e_i\\] then the fitted value for observation \\(i\\) equals \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i\\); that is, the model’s prediction for a residual (\\(e_i\\)) of zero. fixed effect An effect assumed to be identical over all sampling units. In the standard regression model \\[Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + e_i\\] the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) (the intercept) and \\(\\beta_1\\) (the slope) are assumed to be constant across all sampling units (e.g. subjects). These are contrasted with random effects, which are effects that differ across the units. fixed factor A factor whose levels are assumed to represent all the levels of interest in a population; its levels would remain fixed across replications of the study. For example, if you were studying the nations making up the United Kingdom, you would have a factor with the levels England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. If you would replicate a study, you would include these exact same levels. These four levels represent all the nations comprising the union, and there usually would be no interest in generalizing beyond the data to other (hypothetical) nations. Fixed factors are usually contrasted with random factors, whose levels usually are assumed to be the result of (quasi-)random sampling. function A named section of code that can be reused. For example, sd is a function that returns the standard deviation of the vector of numbers that you provide as the input argument. Functions are set up like this: function_name(argument1 = a1, argument2 = a2). The arguments in parentheses can be named (like, x = c(1,3,5,8)) or you can skip the names if you put them in the exact same order that they’re defined in the function.

["g.html", "G generalizability geom git github global environment", " G generalizability A term referring to the degree to which findings can be readily applied to situations beyond the particular context in which the data were collected. In the ideal case, we want our findings to be as generalizable as possible. However, when collecting data, we face limitations in the kinds of people, stimuli, and situations we are able to observe. Findings from a study are not generalizable if they do not apply beyond the context in which they are collected.

That is, you can assume 3 is higher than 2, but the difference between 2 and 3 isn’t always the same as the difference between 1 and 2. Therefore, think carefully before averaging Likert values, since the average of 2 and 4 is not necessarily equal to 3. Linear mixed-effects model A type of regression model that involves estimating both fixed effects and random effects. Most conventional regression models only estimate parameters associated with fixed effects and residual error. Mixed-effects models additionally estimate random effects parameters that capture variability associated with sampling units. In psychology, these sampling units are usually human participants or stimulus items. Linear mixed-effects models are often called multi-level models or hierarchical models; these terms are roughly interchangeable. Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) are still linear models in the sense that they model a response variable in terms of a linear combination of predictor variables whose values are weighted by parameter estimates. Because there is no closed form solution to finding the optimal parameter estimates, their values are typically estimated through an iterative procedure that searches the space of possible values for the optimum. The function lmer() from the R package lme4 is often used to estimate mixed-effects models. The brms package in R allows Bayesian estimation of mixed-effects models. list A container data type that allows items with different data types to be grouped together. logical A data type representing TRUE or FALSE values. true_logical_values &lt;- list( TRUE, T, as.logical(1), &quot;A&quot; == &quot;A&quot; ) false_logical_values &lt;- list( FALSE, F, as.logical(0), &quot;A&quot; == &quot;B&quot; ) str(true_logical_values) str(false_logical_values) ## List of 4 ## $ : logi TRUE ## $ : logi TRUE ## $ : logi TRUE ## $ : logi TRUE ## List of 4 ## $ : logi FALSE ## $ : logi FALSE ## $ : logi FALSE ## $ : logi FALSE long Data where each observation is on a separate row Contrast with wide data.

A multilevel dataset is one where there are repeated measurements on the same subjects on the same variable. If you have multiple measurements on the same subjects but on different variables, with no more than one measurement per subject per variable, you have multivariate data, not multilevel data. It is called “multilevel” because different measurements might be taken at different levels. For example, in a simple reaction time study, you may measure how quickly someone presses a button in response to a flashing light. You can have measurements at the level of the individual trial (the intensity of the flash) as well as measurements at the level of the individual subject (the subject’s age in years). A multilevel model is one that can account for the variance introduced at the various levels.

Many useful functions are built into R and available by default whenever you start it up. But some of the most powerful things you can do with R require packages of functions that are written by the community. The functions in these packages aren’t available until you install the package (using install.packages(\"package_name\") or clicking Install on the Packages pane; this only needs to be done if the package isn’t already installed). Once that package is installed (kind of like downloading an app to your phone), you can use it in any script by loading that package as a library at the top of your script (e.g., (library(ggplot2)). You can alternatively type the package name and two colons before any function from that package to use it without loading all of its functions into the library (e.g., ggplot2::geom_histogram()). This sort of notation is also used to disambiguate function names if two packages have functions with the same names. panes RStudio is arranged with four window “panes”. By default, the upper left pane is the source pane, where you view and edit source code from files. The bottom left pane is usually the console pane, where you can type in commands and view output messages You can change the location of panes and what tabs are shown under Preferences &gt; Pane Layout.

In a psychology context, parameters are constants that are assumed to reflect a typical values for some property appearing in some human group to which we want to generalized. For instance, it may reflect an overall reaction time or an overall priming effect, with individual subjects varying from this fixed value. Population parameters are typically unobserved and usually unobservable due to sampling error and measurement error, and are estimated from the values in the sample. The exception is in data simulation, where hypothetical population parameters can be fixed by the researcher. population All members of a group that we wish to generalise our findings to. E.g. all students taking Psychology at the University of Glasgow. We draw our testing sample from the population.. The population of interest can be any group and it is important that you define this in your study when considering the generalisability of your tests and how you will conduct your sampling. If you want to generalise to everyone in the world then that is the population you should sample from. If you want to generalise to everyone taking Psychology at the University of Glasgow then those are the people you should specifically sample from. Remember that populations don’t have to be humans but could refer to all possible variations of a face for example. The key question is who or what do your results generalise to.

Resources: Introduction to R Markdown R Markdown Cheatsheet R Markdown Reference random effect An effect associated with an individual sampling unit, usually represented by an offset from a fixed effect. Example: If the grand mean response time in a population is 600 milliseconds, that number represents the typical value. The mean response time for an individual subject \\(s\\) can be represented as an offset (deviation) from that value. For example, if subject \\(s\\) has a mean reaction time of 650 ms, that would imply a random effect for that subject of +50 ms. Unlike fixed effects, we expect the underlying random effects to change from experiment to experiment as the sampling units (e.g., subjects) change. random factor A factor whose levels are taken to represent a proper subset of a population of interest, typically because the observed levels are the result of sampling. If you perform a study where the population of interest is “undergraduates at the University of Glasgow”, you are very unlikely to obtain data from all approximately 20,000 undergraduate students. Instead, you would likely obtain a (hopefully random) sample of undergraduates, with each undergraduate forming a single ‘level’ of the ‘subject’ factor. By treating ‘subject’ as random rather than fixed in your analysis, you will obtain parameter estimates that are closer to the true population values. random seed A value used to set the initial state of a random number generator. Random seeds are used in random number generation. Each time you generate a random number, the number you get depends on the state of the underlying random number generator. If you set this state to a known value, you will get the same random numbers in the same order. Random seeds are used to make processes that involve random values reproducible. In R, you can set a random seed using the set.seed() function. If you put set.seed() at the start of your script, you will get the same output every time. reactivity Changes in a Shiny app that occur in response to user input. Reactive features of your UI are rendered in the server. relative path The location of a file in relation to the working directory. For example, if your working directory is /Users/lisad/face_study/ and you want to refer to a file in the directory /Users/lisad/face_study/data/faces.csv, the relative path is data/faces.csv. Use ../ to move up one directory. # the working directory: /Users/lisad/face_study/ # read a file inside the wd: /Users/lisad/face_study/data/faces.csv qdat &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/faces.csv&quot;) # read a file outside the wd: /Users/lisad/other_study/data/exp.csv xdat &lt;- read_csv(&quot;../other_study/data/exp.csv&quot;) Make sure you always use relative paths in an R Markdown document, which automatically sets the working directory to the directory that contains the .Rmd file. repeated measures A dataset has repeated measures if there are multiple measurements taken on the same variable for individual sampling units. See also multilevel. replicability The extent to which the findings of a study can be repeated with new samples from the same population. See also reproducibility. reproducibility The extent to which the findings of a study can be repeated in some other context, either with new samples from the same population (replicability) or with the same raw data but analyzed by different researchers or by the same researchers on a different occasion (computational or analytical reproducibility). reproducible research Research that documents all of the steps between raw data and results in a way that can be verified. residual error That part of an observation that cannot be captured by the statistical model, and thus is assumed to reflect unknown factors. Mathematically, residual error is defined as the observed value of a variable minus the fitted value for that observation from the model. response variable A variable (in a regression) whose value is assumed to be influenced by one or more predictor variables. In an experimental context, the response variable is often referred to as the dependent variable. RStudio An integrated development environment (IDE) that helps you process R code.

["s.html", "S sample script server SESOI set operations shinydashboard significant simulation slope standard deviation string", " S sample A subset of the population that you wish to make an inference about through your test. The sample is a smaller group obtained from your population but it is key that the sample is representative of the population As in most instances it is realistically impossible to test all members of a population, a sample is derived, that represents the population of interest, from the population. The sample should have the same demographic characteristics as the population for example. If your sample is not representative of the population then any conclusions derived from your test are invalid. Worth noting that if the population is small enough to feasibly test in full, e.g. all students in a final year Psychology class, then your sample and the population are the same.

See a great overview of widgets at the RStudio Shiny tutorial. In shiny apps, a widget is created by its function. The first argument is the name you will use in the code for referring to that widget and its value, so make sure it’s a unique, descriptive name like plot_color or group1_label. The second argument is the label, which is a string like \"Plot colour\" or \"Label for the first group\" (it can also be an empty string like \"\"). working directory The filepath where R is currently reading and writing files. If you are working in a project, the working directory is usually the main project directory. So if you want to save a file into a folder called “data” in that project folder, you can use a relative path, which is automatically appended to the working directory, such as readr::write_csv(my_data, \"data/my_data.csv\"). getwd() .html# get the current working directory setwd(&quot;~/r/myfiles&quot;) .html# change the working directory Never set or change your working directory in a script.
