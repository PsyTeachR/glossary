This is a great way to keep track of more complicated scripts. concatenate To combine strings or vectors. When referring to strings, concatenate means to add strings together using the function paste (adds a space between strings) or paste0 (doesn’t add anything between strings). subject_name &lt;- &quot;Lisa&quot; paste(&quot;Hello,&quot;, subject_name) #&gt; [1] &quot;Hello, Lisa&quot; When referring to other types of variables, concatenate can mean to create a vector with those variables, usually using the c function. For example, you could concatenate the numbers 1, 3, 6, and 10 like this: c(1, 3, 6, 10). You can concatenate two vectors as well: v1 &lt;- 1:5 v2 &lt;- 11:15 c(v1, v2) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 Remember, a vector can only have one data type.

For example, 95% Confidence Intervals of the mean state that if you were to run the same study on 100 samples and calculate this interval for each iteration of the study, then 95 of the intervals calculated will contain the true mean of the population. Most commonly cited Confidence Intervals are the 95% Confidence Interval and the 99% Confidence Interval. The 95% CI and 99% CI of the mean are calculated as follows: \\(95\\%\\ CI = \\mu ± 1.96 \\times SD\\) \\(99\\%\\ CI = \\mu ± 2.58 \\times SD\\) For example, given \\(\\mu\\) = 10 and \\(SD\\) = 1.25, the \\(95\\%\\ CI = [7.55, 12.45]\\) There are a number of misconceptions about Confidence Intervals and it would be worth reading the following papers: Greenland, S., Senn, S.J., Rothman, K.J. et al. Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations.

As opposed to discrete data, where fractional values don’t make sense, continuous data can take fractional values (as far as the sensitivity of the measurement allows). So even if you are measuring height to the nearest whole centimeter, this is continuous data because it is possible and makes sense for intermediate values to exist.

These are contrasted with random effects, which are effects that differ across the units. fixed factor A factor whose levels are assumed to represent all the levels of interest in a population; its levels would remain fixed across replications of the study. For example, if you were studying the nations making up the United Kingdom, you would have a factor with the levels England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. If you would replicate a study, you would include these exact same levels. These four levels represent all the nations comprising the union, and there usually would be no interest in generalizing beyond the data to other (hypothetical) nations.

That is, you can assume 3 is higher than 2, but the difference between 2 and 3 isn’t always the same as the difference between 1 and 2. Therefore, think carefully before averaging Likert values, since the average of 2 and 4 is not necessarily equal to 3. Linear mixed-effects model A type of regression model that involves estimating both fixed effects and random effects. Most conventional regression models only estimate parameters associated with fixed effects and residual error. Mixed-effects models additionally estimate random effects parameters that capture variability associated with sampling units. In psychology, these sampling units are usually human participants or stimulus items. Linear mixed-effects models are often called multi-level models or hierarchical models; these terms are roughly interchangeable. Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) are still linear models in the sense that they model a response variable in terms of a linear combination of predictor variables whose values are weighted by parameter estimates. Because there is no closed form solution to finding the optimal parameter estimates, their values are typically estimated through an iterative procedure that searches the space of possible values for the optimum. The function lmer() from the R package lme4 is often used to estimate mixed-effects models. The brms package in R allows Bayesian estimation of mixed-effects models. list A container data type that allows items with different data types to be grouped together. logical A data type representing TRUE or FALSE values. true_logical_values &lt;- list( TRUE, T, as.logical(1), &quot;A&quot; == &quot;A&quot; ) false_logical_values &lt;- list( FALSE, F, as.logical(0), &quot;A&quot; == &quot;B&quot; ) str(true_logical_values) str(false_logical_values) #&gt; List of 4 #&gt; $ : logi TRUE #&gt; $ : logi TRUE #&gt; $ : logi TRUE #&gt; $ : logi TRUE #&gt; List of 4 #&gt; $ : logi FALSE #&gt; $ : logi FALSE #&gt; $ : logi FALSE #&gt; $ : logi FALSE long Data where each observation is on a separate row Contrast with wide data.

A multilevel dataset is one where there are repeated measurements on the same subjects on the same variable. If you have multiple measurements on the same subjects but on different variables, with no more than one measurement per subject per variable, you have multivariate data, not multilevel data. It is called “multilevel” because different measurements might be taken at different levels. For example, in a simple reaction time study, you may measure how quickly someone presses a button in response to a flashing light. You can have measurements at the level of the individual trial (the intensity of the flash) as well as measurements at the level of the individual subject (the subject’s age in years). A multilevel model is one that can account for the variance introduced at the various levels. See also repeated measures. "],

Many useful functions are built into R and available by default whenever you start it up.

The functions in these packages aren’t available until you install the package (using install.packages(\"package_name\") or clicking Install on the Packages pane; this only needs to be done if the package isn’t already installed). Once that package is installed (kind of like downloading an app to your phone), you can use it in any script by loading that package as a library at the top of your script (e.g., (library(ggplot2)). You can alternatively type the package name and two colons before any function from that package to use it without loading all of its functions into the library (e.g., ggplot2::geom_histogram()). This sort of notation is also used to disambiguate function names if two packages have functions with the same names. panes RStudio is arranged with four window “panes”. By default, the upper left pane is the source pane, where you view and edit source code from files.

In a psychology context, parameters are constants that are assumed to reflect a typical values for some property appearing in some human group to which we want to generalized. For instance, it may reflect an overall reaction time or an overall priming effect, with individual subjects varying from this fixed value. Population parameters are typically unobserved and usually unobservable due to sampling error and measurement error, and are estimated from the values in the sample. The exception is in data simulation, where hypothetical population parameters can be fixed by the researcher. population All members of a group that we wish to generalise our findings to. E.g. all students taking Psychology at the University of Glasgow. We draw our testing sample from the population.. The population of interest can be any group and it is important that you define this in your study when considering the generalisability of your tests and how you will conduct your sampling. If you want to generalise to everyone in the world then that is the population you should sample from.

Resources: Introduction to R Markdown R Markdown Cheatsheet R Markdown Reference random effect An effect associated with an individual sampling unit, usually represented by an offset from a fixed effect. Example: If the grand mean response time in a population is 600 milliseconds, that number represents the typical value. The mean response time for an individual subject \\(s\\) can be represented as an offset (deviation) from that value. For example, if subject \\(s\\) has a mean reaction time of 650 ms, that would imply a random effect for that subject of +50 ms. Unlike fixed effects, we expect the underlying random effects to change from experiment to experiment as the sampling units (e.g., subjects) change. random factor A factor whose levels are taken to represent a proper subset of a population of interest, typically because the observed levels are the result of sampling. If you perform a study where the population of interest is “undergraduates at the University of Glasgow”, you are very unlikely to obtain data from all approximately 20,000 undergraduate students. Instead, you would likely obtain a (hopefully random) sample of undergraduates, with each undergraduate forming a single ‘level’ of the ‘subject’ factor. By treating ‘subject’ as random rather than fixed in your analysis, you will obtain parameter estimates that are closer to the true population values. reactivity Changes in a Shiny app that occur in response to user input. Reactive features of your UI are rendered in the server. relative path The location of a file in relation to the working directory. For example, if your working directory is /Users/lisad/face_study/ and you want to refer to a file in the directory /Users/lisad/face_study/data/faces.csv, the relative path is data/faces.csv. Use ../ to move up one directory. # the working directory: /Users/lisad/face_study/ # read a file inside the wd: /Users/lisad/face_study/data/faces.csv qdat &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/faces.csv&quot;) # read a file outside the wd: /Users/lisad/other_study/data/exp.csv xdat &lt;- read_csv(&quot;../other_study/data/exp.csv&quot;) Make sure you always use relative paths in an R Markdown document, which automatically sets the working directory to the directory that contains the .Rmd file. repeated measures A dataset has repeated measures if there are multiple measurements taken on the same variable for individual sampling units. See also multilevel. reproducibility The extent to which the findings of a study can be repeated in some other context, either with new samples from the same population (replicability) or with the same raw data but analyzed by different researchers or by the same researchers on a different occasion (computation or analytical reproducibility). reproducible research Research that documents all of the steps between raw data and results in a way that can be verified. response variable A variable (in a regression) whose value is assumed to be influenced by one or more predictor variables. In an experimental context, the response variable is often referred to as the dependent variable. "],
["s.html", "S sample script server shinydashboard slope standard deviation string", " S sample A subset of the population that you wish to make an inference about through your test. The sample is a smaller group obtained from your population but it is key that the sample is representative of the population As in most instances it is realistically impossible to test all members of a population, a sample is derived, that represents the population of interest, from the population. The sample should have the same demographic characteristics as the population for example. If your sample is not representative of the population then any conclusions derived from your test are invalid. Worth noting that if the population is small enough to feasibly test in full, e.g. all students in a final year Psychology class, then your sample and the population are the same.

The server is a function that processes the user’s input in the UI, and allows the app to render appropriate output. See this shiny basics article for more. shinydashboard A package for R that builds on Shiny for more flexible and visually appealing UIs. Shiny Dashboard or shinydashboard can be installed with install.packages(\"shinydashboard\"), and can be loaded with library(shinydashboard). The shinydashboard documentation is a great introduction to this package. slope A quantity that captures how much change in one variable is associated with a unit increase in another variable. If you have a slope of 3, that means that a unit increase in the \\(X\\) variable is associated with a 3 unit change in the \\(Y\\) variable. If you have a slope of -1/2, then a unit increase in the \\(X\\) variable is associated with a decrease of 1/2 in the \\(Y\\) variable. standard deviation A statistic that measures how spread out data are relative to the mean. If the data points are further from the mean, there is a higher standard deviation. Standard deviation is calculated as the square root of the variance. Normal distributions with means of 0 and SDs of 1 (red), 2 (blue) and 3 (purple). Figure 9: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! string A piece of text inside of quotes. For example, \"I sense the rains down in Africa\" is a string. Numbers inside of quotes can be a string; \"19\" is a string, while 19 is not. Strings are a character data type. "],
