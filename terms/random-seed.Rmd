## random seed

<dfn>A value used to set the initial state of a random number generator.</dfn>

Random seeds are used in random number generation. Each time you generate a random number, the number you get depends on the state of the underlying random number generator. If you set this state to a known value, you will get the same random numbers in the same order.

Random seeds are used to make processes that involve random values reproducible. In R, you can set a random seed using the `set.seed()` function. If you put `set.seed()` at the start of your script, you will get the same output every time.

```{r}
set.seed(1) # a different seed
rnorm(3)
```

```{r}
set.seed(8675309) # the first seed again
