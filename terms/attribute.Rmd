## attribute

<dfn>Extra information about an R object</dfn>

You can access an [object](o.html#object)'s attributes with `attr()`. For example, datasets simulated with [faux](https://debruine.github.io/faux/){target="_blank"} have an attribute called "design" that details their design.

```{r}
data <- faux::sim_design(
  between = list(pet = c(cat = "Cat Owners", 
                         dog = "Dog Owners")),
  within = list(time = c(am = "Morning", 
                         pm = "Night")),
  mu = 1:4,
  r = list(cat = 0.3, dog = 0.6),
  dv = c(score = "Happiness Scale Score"),
  plot = FALSE)

attr(data, "design")
```


## attribute (html) {#attribute-html}

<dfn>Extra information about an HTML element</dfn>

For example, the paragraph [element](e.html#element-html) has an attribute of "id" with a value of "feature". This can be used to refer to the element to change its style with [CSS](c.html#css) or affect its behaviour with [JavaScript](j.html#javascript).

``` html
<p id="feature">This is the main paragraoh of my text...</p>
```
