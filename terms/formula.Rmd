## formula

<dfn>A symbolic expression that defines a model.</dfn>

It takes a format like this:

`y ~ 1 + x + z*w - z:w`

The elements of the formula are:  
- `~` : on the left hand side, there is the outcome (y), on the right hand, the predictors.
- `1` : refers to the intercept that does not have to be written out as it is added by default. If you want to remove the intercept, you have to use 0 instead of 1.
- `+` : you can add predictors using the + sign.
- `*` : means to take two (or more) pradictors, and use their main effect AND also their interaction. `z*w` translates into `z + w + z:w`.
- `:` : referes to an interaction, without the main effects of the predictors.
- `-` : removes a predictor. For e.g. `z*w - z:w` translates into: `z + w`

In [linear mixed effects model](l.html#linear-mixed-effects-model) the formula also contains [random effects](r.html#random-effect). For example consider the following models:

`y ~ x + (1|group)`  
`y ~ x + (x|group)`  
`y ~ x + (1|group/cluster)`

- `()` : defines the random effects. Can be more than one random effect.
- `(1|group)` : adds a random intercept by group.
- `(x|group)` : adds a random intercept and slope by group.
- `(1|group/cluster)` : adds a random intercept by group nested in clusters. You can add more levels.
