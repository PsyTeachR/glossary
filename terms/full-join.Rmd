## full_join

<dfn>A [mutating join](m.html#mutating-joins) that lets you join up rows in two tables while keeping all of the information from both tables</dfn>

```{r full-join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Full Join"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joins/full_join.png")
```

```{r ful-join-example-setup}
X <- tibble(
  id = 1:5,
  x = LETTERS[1:5]
)

Y <- tibble(
  id = 2:6,
  y = LETTERS[22:26]
)
```

<table>
  <tr><th>Table X</th><th>Table Y</th></td>
  <tr>
    <td>`r kable(X)`</td>
    <td>`r kable(Y)`</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If there is no matching data in the other table for a row, the values are set to [NA](n.html#na).

```{r full-join-example-a-b}
# a columns come first
data <- full_join(a, b, by = "id")
```

`r kable(data)`

Order is not important for full joins, but does change the order of columns in the resulting table.

```{r full-join-example-b-a}
# b columns come first
data <- full_join(b, a, by = "id")
```

`r kable(data)`
