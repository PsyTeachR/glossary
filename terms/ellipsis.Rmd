## ellipsis

<dfn>Three dots (...) representing further unspecified [arguments](a.html#argument) to a [function](f.html#function).</dfn>

When you look up the help for a function, you often see one of the arguments is `...`. This means that you can supply your own argument names and values here.

  <summary>More...</summary>

For example, the help page for `dplyr::mutate()` shows a usage of `mutate(.data, ...)`, which means that the first argument is called `.data` and is the data table you want to mutate, and the second argument is `...`, which means that you can add as many new arguments as you want and each one will create a new column with the argument name and value.

```{r}
# create a data frame with letters and numbers 
df <- data.frame(
  number = 1:5,
  letter = LETTERS[1:5]
)

# the mutate function lets you add custom arguments
# like lower and plus_10
mutate(
  .data = df,
  lower = tolower(letter),
  plus_10 = number + 10
)

```
