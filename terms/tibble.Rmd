## tibble

<dfn>A [container](c.html#container) for [tabular data](t.html#tabular-data) with some different properties to a [data frame](d.html#data-frame)</dfn>

Tibbles are almost exactly like the [base R](b.html#base-r) `data.frame` container type, but has some special printing functions, does not coerce [character](c.html#character) columns to [factors](f.html#factor), and does not typically use row names.

```{r}
# display the mtcars data frame
mtcars
```
```{r}
# convert the mtcars data frame to a tibble
tibble::as_tibble(mtcars, rownames = "name")
```
