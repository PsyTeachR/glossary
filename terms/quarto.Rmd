## quarto

<dfn>An open-source scientific and technical publishing system.</dfn>

Quarto allows you to combine text and code to produce formatted documents, web pages, blog posts, books and more. See <https://quarto.org/> for documentation and examples.

While quarto is similar to [R Markdown](r.html#r-markdown), there are some differences in code chunk syntax, and it does not require R to run, so can be used with many coding languages, or even without code.
