## error term

<dfn>The term in a model that represents the difference between the actual and predicted values</dfn>

Model [formulae](f.html#formula) typically do not include an explicit error term; it is implicit. For example, the linear model formula below only includes a main effect of `group`; the [intercept](i.html#intercept) and error term are implied.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lm(dv ~ group, data = df)
```


See [residual](r.html#residual) for a concrete example.
