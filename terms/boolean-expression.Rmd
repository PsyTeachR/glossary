## boolean expression

<dfn>An expression that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE.</dfn>

Boolean expressions usually use a relational [operator](o.html#operator), such as `==` or `>` to compare two values.

```{r}
# == 	Equal to 	
1 == 1
1 == 2
```


```{r}
# != 	Not equal to 	
1 != 2
1 != 1
```


```{r}
# > 	Greater than
2 > 1
1 > 2
```


```{r}
# >= 	Greater than or equal to
2 >= 1
1 >= 2
```


```{r}
# < 	Less than
1 < 2
2 < 1
```


```{r}
# <= 	Less than or equal to
1 <= 2
2 <= 1
```


```{r}
# %in% 	Match operator 	
"A" %in% LETTERS
"1" %in% LETTERS
```
