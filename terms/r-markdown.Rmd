## R markdown

<dfn>The R-specific version of markdown: a way to specify formatting, such as headers, paragraphs, lists, bolding, and links, as well as code blocks and inline code.</dfn>

An R markdown file starts with a [YAML](y.html#yaml) header that usually contains the title, author, and output type. 

```
---
title: "Analysis Plan Template"
author: "School of Psychology, University of Glasgow"
output: html_document
---
```

The rest of the file is a mix of [markdown](m.html#markdown) and [code chunks](c.html#chunk). Here is an example of two section titles. The first section has an r chunk for loading the packages and the second section has a list of steps.

````
## Packages used

```{r setup, include = FALSE}`r ''`
# every time you add a new package, include it in this section
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data Processing

1. load in packages
2. load in dataset
3. Wrangle data into appropriate format for analysis and checks. You might want to reshape the data or combine different values to make a new variable.
