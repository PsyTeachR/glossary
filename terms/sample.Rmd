## sample

<dfn>A subset of the [population](p.html#population) that you wish to make an inference about through your test.</dfn>

The sample is a smaller group obtained from your population, but it is key that the sample is representative of the population.

In most instances, it is realistically impossible to test all members of a population. A sample is derived from the population of interest to represent that population. The sample should have the same demographic characteristics as the population, for example. If your sample is not representative of the population, then any conclusions derived from your test may be invalid.

If the population is small enough to feasibly test in full, e.g. all students in a final year Psychology class, then your sample and the population are the same.

In R, `sample()` is a function which can be used to pull an arbitrary number of elements from a vector. For instance, you can use `sample` to randomly draw five numbers (with or without replacement) from a vector containing the numbers 1 to 10:

```{r}
set.seed(4491) # set seed for reprodicibilty
# create a vector containing the numbers 1 to 10
v <- 1:10
v

# sample 5 numbers from v without replacement
sample(v, 5)
# sample 5 numbers from v with replacement
sample(v, 5, replace = TRUE)
```
