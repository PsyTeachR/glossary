## class

<dfn>A way to categorise objects</dfn>

A class is similar to a [data type](d.html#data-type), but object can have more than one class.

  <summary>More...</summary>

```{r}
# character class and type
class("A")
typeof("A")
```


```{r}
# numeric class and double type
class(1.1)
typeof(1.1)
```


```{r}
# numeric class and integer type
class(1L)
typeof(1L)
```


```{r}
# function class and closure type
class(mean)
typeof(mean)
```

Classes often control how an object is printed. For example, the result of `t.test()` is a list with class "htest", which is why printing the result gives you formatted output.

```{r}
t <- t.test(rnorm(10), rnorm(10))
typeof(t)
class(t)
t
```

If you `unclass()` an object, it no longer gets specical printing styles.

```{r}
unclass(t)
```
