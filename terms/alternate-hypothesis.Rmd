## alternate hypothesis

<dfn>The hypothesis that an observed difference between groups or from a specific value is NOT due to chance alone.</dfn>

The alternate hypothesis is also commonly referred to as [H1](h.html#h1). This is contrasted with [H0](h.html#h0), the [null hypothesis](n.html#null-hypothesis) in a null hypothesis significance testing ([NHST](n.html#nhst)) framework.
