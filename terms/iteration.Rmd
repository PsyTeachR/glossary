## iteration

<dfn>Repeating a process or function</dfn>

Repeating a process or function is useful when we want to perform the same operation more than once on elements. 
A simple example of this would be to add the number 2 to each element in a `r glossary("vector")`.

In `R` this can be done, for instance, with the help of `for-loops()`:
 
```{r}
# create a vector containing the numbers 1 to 4
v <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)

for(i in 1:4){
  
 v[i] <- v[i] + 2
 
}

# 2 is added to each element in v
v
```

A quicker way to iterate through elements in a `r glossary("vector")` or a list is to use the function `purrr::modify()` or `sapply()`:

```{r}
purrr::modify(v, function(x) x + 2)

sapply(v, function(x) x + 2)
```
