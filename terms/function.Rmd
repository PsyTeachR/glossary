## function

<dfn>A named section of code that can be reused.</dfn> 

For example, `sd` is a function that returns the standard deviation of the [vector](#vector) of numbers that you provide as the input [argument](#argument). Functions are set up like this: `function_name(argument1 = a1, argument2 = a2)`. The [argument](#argument)s in parentheses can be named (like, `x = c(1,3,5,8)`) or you can skip the names if you put them in the exact same order that they're defined in the function. You can check this by typing `?sd` (or whatever function name you're looking up) into the console and the Help pane will show you the default order under **Usage**.
